<h2>Introduction to Self-Driving Cars as a Disruptive Technology</h2>

<p>The self-driving car is an example of disruptive technology projected to be the future of transportation. These vehicles are capable of driving themselves by sensing their environment through built-in features such as motion sensors, blind-spot detectors, and enhanced cruise control. It is estimated that by the 2040s to 2060s, self-driving cars will significantly replace human-driven cars on roads. Findings of a survey by Bagloee et al. (2016) have shown that this technology can offer many benefits which include reducing traffic jams, road congestion, air emissions, and fuel efficiency. However, there are competing claims on its implications and how it will impact the economy such as issues on unemployment and reduction in transport services. If self-driving cars are normalized, many transport services such as driving, vehicle service and repair, commercial transport, and parking services will be decreased significantly (Litman, 2017). The implementation of these automated cars can potentially trigger debilitating economic consequences in society. While the technology offers undisputable benefits, these advantages may come at the cost of service drivers’ jobs and other transport services in the industry. There is also the risk of system failures which may lead to road accidents.</P>

<h2>Drisruptive Effects of Self Driving Cars</h2>


<P>According to Davies and Marshall (2021), when self-driving cars were first introduced, they were unimpressive since it was only limited to a few hundred drivers and required a human safety operator to monitor behind the wheels. As time progressed, it was opened to the public without needing a human to be extremely attentive when driving the vehicle. This attracted many investors which caused a great advancement in the machine learning field. Although it was quite an improvement, there where consequences for these innovations.</P>

<h2>Current Progress of Self-driving Cars & Plans to Achieve This</h2>
                   
<p>As technology advances at a rapid pace, US road-safety officials and the US government were forced to intervene, and the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) issued official rules for autonomous-car research in September 2016. Manufacturers must pass a "safety evaluation" before releasing their vehicles to the public, according to the standards. They even classified the degrees of self-driving automobile technology, with Level 1 being the most basic (adaptive cruise control, lane assist, etc.). Level 2 is the closest to what we have in the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (semi-autonomous driving), while Level 5 is full autonomy. Apparently, just one business currently offers Level 3 autonomous systems (Tesla's Autopilot system). Encouraged by the Tesla Model 3's instant popularity (which should have self-driving capability and available in 2017), automobile manufacturers began to invest massive sums of money in creating self-driving cars. </P>

<P>Furthermore, Audi is expected to unveil its flagship A8, and as part of its Audi piloted-driving initiative, the car will be able to park and drive (up to 37 miles per hour) autonomously. Tesla Motors revealed that all future vehicles will be equipped with Level 5 autonomous driving hardware. In the coming years, it will issue software updates that will enable full functionality in stages. Interestingly, Tesla has created a quite different self-driving system than almost all of the others. The new Level 5 features should employ eight cameras to provide a 360-degree view. It will also employ 12 upgraded ultrasonic sensors to monitor the vehicle's surroundings, as well as a few radars to detect nearby things. The vision neural net will process all of the data and instruct the Tesla car on how to behave, where to go, and how to react. 
</P>
<P>Surprisingly, this method is very different from what we've seen in self-driving cars like Google's or Ford's. They employ laser-scanning technology to scan the car's surroundings by marking millions of spots and calculating the time it takes for a light beam to return to the system's sensor. This gives them a real-time feel of their environment. The LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensing device, which has to be on top of the car, is a little off. Self-driving cars would necessitate big design modifications, whereas the Tesla Level 5 technology appears to work without any major design changes.</P>
