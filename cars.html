<h2>Introduction to Self-Driving Cars</h2>

<p>The self-driving car is an example of disruptive technology projected to be the future of transportation. These vehicles are capable of driving themselves by sensing their environment through built-in features such as motion sensors, blind-spot detectors, and enhanced cruise control. It is estimated that by the 2040s to 2060s, self-driving cars will significantly replace human-driven cars on roads. Findings of a survey by Bagloee et al. (2016) have shown that this technology can offer many benefits which include reducing traffic jams, road congestion, air emissions, and fuel efficiency. However, there are competing claims on its implications and how it will impact the economy such as issues on unemployment and reduction in transport services. If self-driving cars are normalized, many transport services such as driving, vehicle service and repair, commercial transport, and parking services will be decreased significantly (Litman, 2017). The implementation of these automated cars can potentially trigger debilitating economic consequences in society. While the technology offers undisputable benefits, these advantages may come at the cost of service drivers’ jobs and other transport services in the industry. There is also the risk of system failures which may lead to road accidents.</P>


<h2>Self-driving car: the Most Disruptive Technology of Our Time?</h2>

<P>We aim to explain the potential of self-driving cars as a disruptive technology within the car manufacturing industry which will supposedly challenge the game of how cars are built and the use of cars as a mode of transportation in the whole. While pure automatic and self-driving cars are yet to be a norm in society, the concept of such has always been debated as a disruptive technology. Because of this, we will mainly discuss the concept of self-driving cars as detailed by detailed predictions and goals of companies willing to invest in it. Purely ‘automatic’ vehicles in this sense is in a unique kind of standing as a disruptive technology as the concept is not new, since the late 1800s when automobiles were invented many had dreamed of a future wherein self-driving and even flying cars were the norm. This concept is so anticipated that it is named a major potential disruptive technology practically before it even exists. Many companies are currently investing in making this feat possible and questioning the impact of this future endeavor is necessary to determine the safety precautions necessary, the protection of human life, how this challenges the major car manufacturers, the availability of automatic cars to the public, and how this technology will affect society as a whole.</P>

<P>When considering disruptive technologies, it is important to discuss the scale of its impacts, including its benefactors and competitors. It must be established that while a technology may be disruptive in one business area it will always be of benefit to another, which affects its perception as a disruptive technology. For example, a pure self-driving car will challenge the commercial car industry, which builds cars to be driven by human drivers. On the other hand, this technology would seem to be of benefit to the food and delivery system industries, along with ride-hailing networks. Companies like Uber, Grab, and the like could make use of this technology as they would no longer need to pay for human resource drivers, which serve as their largest expense. Thus, self-driving cars would be seen as a sustaining innovation—if they were to rent cars instead of owning them entirely. </P>

<p>One needs to take into account that this argument of ‘being considered a disruptive technology on one side and being considered a sustaining technology on the other’ can be said for nearly any kind of technology. Thus, it must be kept in mind that self-driving cars as a disruptive technology is applicable to the majority, that is the industries in which it applies to. Production of civilian vehicles remains the largest within the car industry among the other industries reaping benefits from cars. Therefore, within the larger market, it is considered a disruptive technology, and one of the major ones at that.</p>

<h2>Drisruptive Effects of Self Driving Cars</h2>


<P>According to Davies and Marshall (2021), when self-driving cars were first introduced, they were unimpressive since it was only limited to a few hundred drivers and required a human safety operator to monitor behind the wheels. As time progressed, it was opened to the public without needing a human to be extremely attentive when driving the vehicle. This attracted many investors which caused a great advancement in the machine learning field. Although it was quite an improvement, there where consequences for these innovations.</P>

<p>The automobile industry's dependence on an operator (someone who is knowledgeable and capable enough to utilize and drive the vehicle alongside many others without causing accidents) is one of the limitations society decided to solve, because no operator meant no transportation. In comes the autonomous car, a vehicle that goes against the standard in this field. Removing the need of what was thought to be essential will completely change how transportation works today. Drivers will eventually become passengers, shifting the focus of car companies to improving passenger experience over optimizing driving experience. Cars will look and function differently, car death and accidents will be significantly reduced, and “location” will cease to be an issue.</p>

<h2>How Do Self-Driving Cars Work?</h2>

<p>There's yet to be a fully autonomous car. What we have right now are semi-autonomous cars with the driver acting as the safety backup in case he/she needs to take full control. Both semi-autonomous cars and fully autonomous cars have digital cameras, lasers, and radar sensors. These things are installed in front of the semi-autonomous cars. Most fully autonomous cars, on the other hand, have a more 3d view of the traffic and road ahead with cameras embedded all around the vehicle. All data gathered by these cameras, lasers, and sensors are interpreted by onboard computers which execute various codes making the vehicle react to road/traffic. Hence, self-driving. Autonomous cars see more and react more than any human driver. Autonomous cars also know where they’re heading through the use of the GPS technology. Manufacturers are putting effort to constantly upgrade this aspect for the machine to not only know where the road is but get a glimpse of the road ahead. In that way, the vehicle would know about the traffic condition ahead or various obstructions that could potentially cause an accident. Vehicle to vehicle feature is also a part of the future. This technology basically allows autonomous vehicles to communicate with one another. A good example is warning one another of potential dangers.</p>

<h2>Current Progress of Self-driving Cars & Plans to Achieve This</h2>
                   
<p>As technology advances at a rapid pace, US road-safety officials and the US government were forced to intervene, and the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) issued official rules for autonomous-car research in September 2016. Manufacturers must pass a "safety evaluation" before releasing their vehicles to the public, according to the standards. They even classified the degrees of self-driving automobile technology, with Level 1 being the most basic (adaptive cruise control, lane assist, etc.). Level 2 is the closest to what we have in the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (semi-autonomous driving), while Level 5 is full autonomy. Apparently, just one business currently offers Level 3 autonomous systems (Tesla's Autopilot system). Encouraged by the Tesla Model 3's instant popularity (which should have self-driving capability and available in 2017), automobile manufacturers began to invest massive sums of money in creating self-driving cars. </P>

<P>Furthermore, Audi is expected to unveil its flagship A8, and as part of its Audi piloted-driving initiative, the car will be able to park and drive (up to 37 miles per hour) autonomously. Tesla Motors revealed that all future vehicles will be equipped with Level 5 autonomous driving hardware. In the coming years, it will issue software updates that will enable full functionality in stages. Interestingly, Tesla has created a quite different self-driving system than almost all of the others. The new Level 5 features should employ eight cameras to provide a 360-degree view. It will also employ 12 upgraded ultrasonic sensors to monitor the vehicle's surroundings, as well as a few radars to detect nearby things. The vision neural net will process all of the data and instruct the Tesla car on how to behave, where to go, and how to react. 
</P>
<P>Surprisingly, this method is very different from what we've seen in self-driving cars like Google's or Ford's. They employ laser-scanning technology to scan the car's surroundings by marking millions of spots and calculating the time it takes for a light beam to return to the system's sensor. This gives them a real-time feel of their environment. The LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensing device, which has to be on top of the car, is a little off. Self-driving cars would necessitate big design modifications, whereas the Tesla Level 5 technology appears to work without any major design changes.</P>
