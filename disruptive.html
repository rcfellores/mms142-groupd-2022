<h2>What is disruptive technology?</h2>

<p>A disruptive technology is one that displaces an established technology and shakes up the industry or a ground-breaking product that creates a completely new industry. 
 
    Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen coined the term disruptive technology. 
    </P>

<P>Another interesting note on disruptive technology is the common misunderstanding built around it. The theory of disruptive innovation was introduced in 1995. However, in the past 20 years the term has been misused to refer to any situation where any industry is challenged by an upcoming innovation.</P>

<p>To further the explanation of disruptive technology it can be described through this scenario: suppose company A is an upcoming but small company with limited resources, this company is able to challenge existing enterprises, say company B, that produce en masse goods for their large consumer base which is made up of their most profitable customers. It is natural that any good product is created with their customers in mind. As such, each product is not designed to cater to everyone as different people have different needs. Company A then caters its products to the overlooked areas that company B does not cater to directly. If company A is able to get a foothold in the market by offering ‘better services’ (this may be in the form of innovative technology that has the potential to shake up the entire market, or as more functionable and affordable goods), then the majority of users will eventually accept company A’s products. It is then that disruption truly occurs, hence it is not the product alone that makes disruption but the context and conditions surrounding it. </p>

<h2>How is disruptive technology different from sustaining technology?</h2>


<P>A technology  is considered sustaining rather than disruptive if the technology evolves slowly and steadily over time. A disruptive technology becomes sustaining when it becomes firmly established.</P>

<h2>Give an example of disruptive technology and explain why and how the given example disrupts the status quo of the market/field/practice it is disrupting.</h2>

<p></p>
			
<p></p>
			
<p>On the topic of electric cars (electric cars and self-driving cars go one in one), there are now many provisions in the near future where internal combustion engines would be completely banned and replaced with fully electric engine cars. An example is the European Union approving a deal to ban combustion engines by 2035 over the efforts of curbing global warming. Canada and the state of California are also banning combustion engines by the same year as the EU. One perceived effect of the disruption of internal combustion engine production is how it would now suddenly give a large surplus of older cars with such engines, which may or may not be donated to third world countries. If this is not regulated, it may defeat the purpose of the ‘zero emissions’ target that is set by these countries in 2050.</p>

<P>Predictions show that in an age where autonomous vehicles become the norm in society, one car will end up replacing 30 traditional cars. Because transportation becomes independent from a human driver, the design industry will shift its focus on maximizing comfort and entertainment, people start managing and thinking about their time differently because they no longer need to drive. Because of this new technology, owning one’s own car would become very expensive. Retail industries will also plummet, just as other newer industries will be born. Car repair shops, car washes, auto part stores are likely to disappear as they function by dealing with customers, who are meant to be drivers. Moreover, automobile insurance will nearly cease to exist. If the goal for autonomous vehicles by engineers and scientists comes true, then by 2040 car accidents will decline by 80%. Because over 90% of car accidents are done by human error, it is the goal for the autonomous industry to reduce that number by a significant amount. Hence, we can see that disruptive technologies not only affect the industry itself and their competitors, but it affects the flow of so many industries and livelihoods around it, especially with as large of an impact as self-driving cars.</P>

<h2>What is the impact of disruptive technology?</h2>

<p></p>
<p></p>

<h2>How disruptive technology is impacting society in general?</h2>

<p>The appearance of a new disruptive technology in the existing market challenges the status quo. Businesses now compete with a common target audience while the new ‘innovative’ technology has an edge in the market due to it being able to provide services that previously existing technologies have not been able to accomplish. In other words, the growth of innovation is seen as beneficial for people investing in it and its potential customers, while it is seen as a challenge in competition for other investors within that same industry.</p>

<h2>How does disruptive technology affect the economy?</h2>

<p>We’re already seeing a lot of innovations in technology that different industries are adopting. While it is difficult to identify the disruptive innovations, entrepreneurs and economists must be equipped with information about what are these technologies that are considered disruptive. In order for us to understand and know how disruptive technology affects the economy, let’s take for example 3D printing. It is being adapted by businesses who are creating replicas of various works of sculptures that have a purpose for mass production. Another is manufacturing firms like Icon, which employ 3D printing to create houses. The construction of a house just takes a day and costs about $10,000 (SYDLE, 2022). </p>
<p>Not just these industries are using 3D printing technology but almost all of the industries are adapting these innovations for convenience and fast service that gives the same output of the objects they wanted to copy and to mass reproduce. Consumers can be guaranteed that the service they will avail is faithful to what the company advertises about their service and products. With this kind of disruptive technology and other technological advances, this will affect the economy for good reason that companies that use this kind of innovations could meet the demand and accommodate the needs of larger people.</p>
